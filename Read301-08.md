- What does REST stand for?
  - `REST` stands for **Re**presentational **S**tate **T**ransfer
- REST APIs are designed around a ____.
  - _Resource!_
- What is an identifer of a resource? Give an example.
  - An _identifier_ of a _resource_ is a URI that identifies that resource.  A good example for that would be the `/weather` URI that we are currently using in our city-explorer-api.
- What are the most common HTTP verbs?
  - The most common are **GET**, **POST**, **PUT**, **PATCH** and **DELETE.**
- What should the URIs be based on?
  - The URIs should be based on nouns, or the resources.
- Give an example of a good URI.
  - `http://city-explorer-206.com/forecast` - has the noun _only_
- What does it mean to have a ‘chatty’ web API? Is this a good or a bad thing?
  - A 'chatty' web API is one that expose several small resources.  This would be considered a bad thing as the more requests there are, the bigger the load on the server.
- What status code does a successful GET request return?
  - A _successful_ **GET** request would return `200(Ok)`
- What status code does an unsuccessful GET request return?
  - An _unsuccessful_ **GET** request would return `404(Not Found`
- What status code does a successful POST request return?
  - A _successful_ **POST** request would return `201(Created)`
- What status code does a successful DELETE request return?
  - A _successful_ **DELETE** request would return `204(No Content)`

## RegExr[^2]

- How would you match a phone number from your city using RegEx?
  - I like the docs, they are fairly intuitive.  Having said that, I did get some help from [Trey Hunner](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2842345/regular-expression-for-finding-phone-numbers) on stack overflow.
