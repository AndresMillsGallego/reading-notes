A table is essentially a collection of data displayed in grid format.  HTML and CSS allow us to control how the rows, columns and cells are laid out and styled.  
Fun Facts:
- The `<table>` tag is what we use to add tables to a site. 
- The cells inside the table are represented by the `<td>` element and the rows by the `<tr>` element.  
- If the tables are long and contain a lot of data you can break the table into sections using the `<thead>`, `<tbody>` and `<tfoot>` elements.  

Programmers used to use HTML to control more of the layout, background and spacing of tables but that is no longer considered good practice.  It is good to learn it however so that you can recognize it if you come across it.  Like with most other elements, CSS is what is used to style tables these days.
