This is a topic that I find interesting, and intriguing, but I don't really know much about how it actually works.  So....I can just add my own code?  Just like that??  It's hard for me to wrap my head around the idea....

## First Reading...."First Timers Only"

I have to say I love this idea!  It takes all the intimidation (real, or imagined!) out of things and really leaves one with no excuse.  If the project is literally _only_ for people with no prior experience, why not add something?

## Third Reading..."What Motivates a Developer to Contribute to Open-Source Software?"

Ahhhh!  This article seems to be getting to the point.
Why do it?  You don't really get credit, or get paid....so....
What's the point?

The article points out that contributing to OOS can:

1. Improve your own coding skills!
2. Gain valuable early experience!
3. Increase community, and peer recognition!  Build that rep....
4. Lead to greater job prospects!
5. Improve the software on a user, and business level!
