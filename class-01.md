# First class, first readings!

After finishing up with Code 102 I took a short break before diving into Code 201.  I am excited to get back into coding, and I was pleasantly surpised to find that we have real physical copies of textbooks this time around!  

Below are some notes from the first few chapters of the textbooks[^1].

**So what are we reading about exactly?**

In Code 102 we began our journey into programming, what makes websites work and how to design them (among many other things).  In 201 we are expanding on these fundamentals and what it takes to be a successfull developer.  We will be looking at HTML, CSS and Javascript mainly as these are the tools that we will use to build our webpages.  

We will be learning a considerable amount on these 3 topics.  Here is a short summary based on what I have read so far:

**HTML**

- HTML pages are text documents that use tags, or elements, which carry attributes.  These attributes offer information on the content of the element.  
- Opening and closing tags are needed most of the time.  The closting tag has an extra forward slash, these tags look something like this:  `<body>,</body>`
                    
- To learn how to use HTML you need to study which tags are availble, how they work, what they can do and where they go!
- It is important to use DOCTYPES like these `<!DOCTYPE html>`so the browser can tell which version of HTML is being used
- It can be helpful to add comments to the code.  This can help you remember to do something, or _why_ you did something in the first place!  It can also be extremely helpful to other people/programmers who will need to see your code at a later time.  

**HTML5**

- HTML5 is the latest version of HTML.  It has added new elements which can make code not only easier to write, but easier to read as well.  
- Older browsers may not be able to read HTML5.  If this is the case then an extra Javascript may be needed.  Luckily this is available and free from Google.  

**Process and Design**

- One may think at first that design and/or layout would be low on a list of priorities, but it is actually one of the most important steps in building a webpage. 
- Most sites are built to communicate a particular idea, product, educational information, etc.  
- It is crucial to think about who/what the potential audience for a specific site will be, and how the site can be built with this audience in mind.  
- Tools like flowcharts, site maps and wireframes are extremely useful when starting the process of building a site.  The site is communication, and it is visual.  Think about how to best use layout, colors, images and grouping of content to achieve the desired result.  

**Javascript**

- _What is a script exactly?_ It is basically a set of orders a computer can follow to achieve a certain goal.  Javascript is what is used to bring _life_ to a webpage.  
- Scripts can be fairly simple, or incredibly complicated.  It is best to break down what you are trying to accomplish, then work out the steps.  Flowcharts come in very handy. 
- It is good practice to keep Javascript code in it's own file.  You can use the .js extension.
- The HTML `<script>` element is used to tell the browser to load the Javascript file.

As you can see there is already a lot to learn here and we have only just begun.  It is incredible to think how much can be done with just these 3 tools!
