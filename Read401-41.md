# React Native

## Getting Started[^1]

Welcome to React Native!

In React, components can be made by using either classes, or functions.

See below for an example of a function based `React` component:

``` JavaScript
  import React from 'react';
import { Text, View } from 'react-native';

const HelloWorldApp = () => {
  return (
    <View style={{
        flex: 1,
        justifyContent: 'center',
        alignItems: 'center'
      }}>
      <Text>Hello, world!</Text>
    </View>
  );
}

export default HelloWorldApp;
```

## React Native[^2]

_**`React` native, why use it?**_

1. Make apps for Android and/or iOS with `React` native!
2. Written in JS, rendered with native code!  Many platforms, one `React`
3. Native development for everyone.  
4. Seamless cross-platform
5. Fast refresh

## Expo[^3]

_**What is Expo?**_

No, it is not a world's fair held in Canada.  

It is a tool that can be used to develop your app so that it runs natively on all devices.

- Develop:
  - Develop for any and all devices with just one codebase!

- Build:
  - Expo can do the heavy lifting!  Expo can help get your finished app into the app store.

- Update:
  - You can update your app with one command! Users can see this fix, without needing to download your app again.


## Ejecting[^4]

Ejecting to ExpoKit....huh?

If you create and Expo project.....and you want a way to add cutom, native modules then ExpoKit is for you!

Expo apps are written in pure `JavaScript` most of the time.
There are some situations where a developer can need native capabilites outside of what `Expo` can offer.

In cases like these, `Expo` allows you to _eject_ your app from the main `Expo` iOS/Android clients.  
These projects will still have dependcies on ExpoKit, so all should continue to work as it did before.

_**Should I "eject"?**_

It could be a good idea if:

- Your project has need of a native module that `Expo` doesn't support (at the time at least).

It may _not_ be a good idea if:

  - `Expo` can build binaries for your app, however if you eject these builds can't happen automatically anymore
  - You are not comofortable writing native code.
  - You enjoy the `React` native upgrades that come with `Expo`.
  - You require `Expo` push notification services
  - You lean into the `Expo` community for help

To install the `Expo` CLI :

``` JavaScipt
  npm install -g expo-cli
```

Make sure all of the necessary configs: [Instructions](https://docs.expo.dev/distribution/building-standalone-apps/#2-configure-appjson)

Then, from your project directory, run:

```JavaScript
  expo eject
```
