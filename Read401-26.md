Beginning with this reading we will be exploring React, more specifically React 18 and all of it's new features.  

Here is a code snippet showing off how the `root` is created then renders "Hello World" in an `h1` element.

```JavaScript
const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root'));
root.render(<h1>Hello, world!</h1>);
```

## Introducing JSX[^2]

_**What is JSX?**_

Is it `HTML`?  Is it `JavaScript`?

The answer is.....yes üòä

Consider this bit of code here:

```JavaScript
  const element = <h1>Hello, world!</h1>;
```

JSX produces `REACT` elements, which then can be rendered to the DOM.

The article explains it here:

> "Instead of artificially separating technologies by putting markup and logic in separate files, React separates concerns with loosely coupled units called ‚Äúcomponents‚Äù that contain both."

You can put any valid `JavaScript` expression inside of `{}` braces in `JSX`.

That includes using `JSX` in for loops, if/else statements, accept it as an argument, or return it from functions.  See below:

``` JavaScript
function getGreeting(user) {
  if (user) {
    return <h1>Hello, {formatName(user)}!</h1>;
  }
  return <h1>Hello, Stranger.</h1>;
}
```

## Rendering Elements[^3]

To render elements in React, we use the "root" DOM and utilize React.DOM.  As the article states,

>"To render a React element, first pass the DOM element to ReactDOM.createRoot(), then pass the React element to root.render():"

``` JavaScript
const element = <h1>Hello, world</h1>;
const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(
  document.getElementById('root')
);
root.render(element);
```

- React elements are immutable
- The only way to update the UI, is to create a _new_ element and pass it to `root.render()`
- Most of the time, `root.render()` is only called once.
