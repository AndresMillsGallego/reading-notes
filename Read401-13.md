## Socket.io Chat Example[^1]

Making  the chat app!

First step:  The Web Framework
- Set up a basic HTML webpage with `Node.js` and `Express`
- The code will look something like this:
  ```JavaScript
  const express = require('express');
  const app = express();
  const http = require('http');
  const server = http.createServer(app);

  app.get('/', (req, res) => {
    res.send('<h1>Hello world</h1>');
  });

  server.listen(3000, () => {
    console.log('listening on *:3000');
  });
  ```

Next we integrate Socket.io, which is composed of two parts:

1.  A server that integrates with the Node.js HTTP server socket.io
2.  A client library that loads on the browser side socket.io-client

Emitting Events:
- This is how we send out information and events using the `.emit()` method
- We also need to make sure that the server is prepared to handle, or listen for these events so it knows what to do next.  We do this with the `.on()` method.
- This code looks something like this:
  - ```JavaScript
    io.on('connection', (socket) => {
      socket.on('chat message', (msg) => {
      io.emit('chat message', msg);
      });
    });
    ```

## Rooms and Namespaces[^2]

### Rooms

![Rooms](https://socket.io/images/rooms.png)

Per the [documents](https://socket.io/docs/v4/rooms/), 
  > "A _room_ is an arbitrary channel that sockets can `join` and `leave`.  It can be used to broadcast events to a subset of clients"

Joining a room could look a bit like this:

```Javascript
  io.on("connection", (socket) => {
    socket.join("some room");
  });
```

When you want to leave, this happens automatically upon disconnecting so no special code is needed here.  You can however, retrieve these rooms by listening to the `disconnecting` event.

### Namespaces

![Namespace](https://socket.io/assets/images/namespaces-088745a8a8882118740f50b6b1232588.png)

A "namespace" is a communication channel that allows us to split our app up over one shared connection.  This looks a lot like a `route`:

```JavaScript
io.of("/orders").on("connection", (socket) => {
  socket.on("order:list", () => {});
  socket.on("order:create", () => {});
});

io.of("/users").on("connection", (socket) => {
  socket.on("user:list", () => {});
});
```
