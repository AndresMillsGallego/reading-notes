- What is OAuth?
  - Simply put, it is a "secure, third part, user-agent, delegated authoriztion"(per the reading).
- Give an example of what using OAuth would look like.
  - It would be like tag team wrestling where in this case the tag team is the two web sites.  If you have one log in method on one site, you can then use that same method on the new site.  At that moment you click "log in with Google" the newer website tags Google in who then authorizes you, then Google tags in the newer site that you are wanting to log in to!
- How does OAuth work? What are the steps that it takes to authenticate the user?
  - Its a lot of back and forth that is happenening in the back-end between the two websites.  Basically by using access tokens, and the users permission, one site uses the other sites authorizes methods to approve the user and allow them access to what they are attempting (if successful).
- What is OpenID?
  - It is similar to OAuth, except that it aims to provide actual authentication as opposed to just authorization.  The idea being to have one lone sign in which would work across multiple websites.

## Authorization and Authentication Flows[^2]

- What is the difference between authorization and authentication?
  - Authorization is granting access, or authorizing access to a user.  Authentication is more about authenticating that the user is who they say they are (for the purpose of logging into an account in this case).
- What is Authorization Code Flow?
  - Authorization Code Flow is where an authorization code is exchanged for a token.
- What is Authorization Code Flow with Proof Key for Code Exchange (PKCE)?
  - This behaves in much of the same way as a standard Authorization Code Flow, but it adds a code verifier which works in conjunction with the token exhange.
- What is Implicit Flow with Form Post?
  - This is meant for applications that are unable to securely store `Client Secrets` as it is a more streamlined basic Flow.
- What is Client Credentials Flow?
  - In this flow, it is the system that authenitcates and authorizes, rather than the user. 
- What is Device Authorization Flow?
  - This is meant for use with devices that aren't the best at handling input.  When you are asked to follow a link on your computer or phone for authorization, this Flow gets used.
- What is Resource Owner Password Flow?
  - This Flow is not recommended since it only relies on using user credentials for authorization (typically a username and password).
