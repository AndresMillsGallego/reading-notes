# Ethics in Tech

For this week's reading we are tasked with choosing an article from two different categories and report on each one. 

Below are my choices:

[Microsoft Employees demand end of ICE contract](https://web.archive.org/web/20211124172013/https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/19/technology/tech-companies-immigration-border.html)

As a first generation immigrant, and a latino myself, this article hit close to home.  After reading it, it brought up a lot of feelings and really made me think.  On one hand, it was great to read about the employees who stepped up to call out Microsoft on their continued work with ICE.  They did not have to do that, and by speaking up could potentially put their jobs at risk.  When (if ever) is it ok to sacrifice our ethics and morality in our careers?  At what point in the chain does responsibility and being complicit break?  While it was wonderful to read about those brave employees, it was disheartening, though not at all surprising, to read about the company's luke warm response.  Corporations often have no problem _saying_ the right things...but they are never quick to actually act.  Microsoft released comments denouncing the actions of ICE, yet they continued to work with them.  

How can one say the following:

>"We will always stand for immigration policies that preserve every personâ€™s dignity and human rights" - Satya Nadella

While continuing to work, and accept money from and organization that is in direct opposition to this statement?

[Big Data is our Civil Rights issue](http://solveforinteresting.com/big-data-is-our-generations-civil-rights-issue-and-we-dont-know-it/)

Wow.   W-O-W.  I am not sure why this article surprised me the way it did.  As soon as you read about data, and how it can be used, it all makes sense.  I have to admit however, that I hadn't really thought about things this way before.  Data _is_ a civil rights issue, or rather...it **could** become one if we let it.  

The example used on collecting surnames and separating neighborhood boundaries based on race was pretty eye opening.  To add to that, stereotypes (as bad as they are) can be based on some truths as well, so certain data could be used for things that were not intended.  

The solution that the author presents seems a sound one.  Don't outlaw data collection, but rather focus on what can be done with that data after it is collected.  

People, corporations especially, won't ever do the right thing by choice.  We need regulations put in place to prevent a whole new version of red-lining from being implemented.

If this is not done, and companies are left to their own devices, then data will indeed become a civil rights issue.
