## The Growth Mindset

* Growth mindset is something that I constantly strive for.  For me the key word is **growth**.  If one has the desire, the drive, and the dedication then almost anything is possible. *

### Three reminders that I use to stay in a Growth Mindset.

1. Remember to welcome a challenge
2. Failure is how we learn and how we grow.  It is ok to fail as long as we learn from it. 
3. Never settle, always be looking to do improve and to learn more.
