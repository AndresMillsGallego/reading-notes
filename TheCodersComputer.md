# Choosing a Text Editor

First off, what is a text editor exactly?

A text editor is pretty much exactly what it sounds like! ðŸ˜„
It is a software tool that you can download, or use online to write and edit your code.  

Choosing the right one may seem daunting, but its like choosing the **"best"** pizza place...the answer will be different for everyone! 
The best thing is to try out a few of them and go with the one that feels the best to you. 
Here are a few things to look for when choosing one:

* It has code completion
  > This feature will autocomplete your code as you type it making it easier and faster to get your code down. 
* It has syntax highlighting
  > This feature will highlight different coding syntax making it easier to read, and easier to spot any errors. 
* It has a variety of themes
   > You are going to be spending a lot of time looking at your text editor.  
   Having a variety of themes could make it easier on the eyes and prevent unecessary fatigue. 
   
Another thing to note, is that most (if not all) computers will come with their own text editor already built in to the machine!  
If that is the case, then why is there a need to search out your own?

Most of the basic text editors that come with your pc/laptop will be very bare bones 
and won't have many (if any) of the above features.  
Since there are so many excellent text editors out there (many of which are free) 
it only makes sense to try some of them out to see what works for you. 

## The Command Line

The command line is one way that the user (you) can interact with your system.  
It is a text based interface and is also called the Terminal.  It will have a prompt, which is where you can enter
your commands.  

There are a lot commands that can be used with the terminal, 
Here is a cheat sheet for some of them. 


|  Command  |         Meaning           | What It Does|
|:---       |         :----:            |        :--- |
| pwd       | Prints Working Directory  | Shows you what directory you are currently in.| 
|     ls    |          List             | Shows a list of what is in your current directory.|
|     cd    |    Change  Directory      | Changes to a different directory.            |
|   mkdir   |   Make  New Directory    | Make a brand new directory            |

There are of course many, many more commands you will learn but this is a good place to start.
