# Choosing a Text Editor

First off, what is a text editor exactly?

A text editor is pretty much exactly what it sounds like! :)
It is a software tool that you can download, or use online to write and edit your code.  

Choosing the right one may seem daunting, but its like choosing the **"best"** pizza place...the answer will be different for everyone! 
The best thing is to try out a few of them and go with the one that feels the best to you. 
Here are a few things to look for when choosing one:

* It has code completion
  > This feature will autocomplete your code as you type it making it easier and faster to get your code down. 
* It has syntax highlighting
  > This feature will highlight different coding syntax making it easier to read, and easier to spot any errors. 
* It has a variety of themes
   > You are going to be spending a lot of time looking at your text editor.  
   Having a variety of themes could make it easier on the eyes and prevent unecessary fatigue.
