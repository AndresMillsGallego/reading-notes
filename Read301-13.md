- What occurred during the same time as the beginning of the decline of women in computer science?
  - Computers became more and more prevelant in people's homes.
- Why does it matter that males had been playing on computers growing up?
  - The prior experience with computers was an advantage when starting to study computer science and soon became an expectation in computer science classes.

- What three take-a-ways do you have looking at this data?
  1. There are not nearly as many women working in these companies as men.  
  2. Where are all the latinos?  Hopefully I can add to these numbers!
  3. There isn't a lot of diversity not only in the tech industry, but in places of power as well.  Hopefully we can continue working on this issue.

- When are diversity efforts most successful?
  - Like with most things, when these efforts start from the top, or maybe even more importantly, are fully supported from the top, they are more successful.
- Why do diverse companies perform better?
  - The reason is in the name I think, the more diverse the company, the more diverse the viewpoints and life experiences will be in the company.  These differences make looking at and resolving a problem that much more efficient.  
- Give an example of how a diverse company can serve a diverse user base or vise-versa.
  - Representation matters in so many ways.  Even in the business sense, if the company is as diverse as its user base, then their products will reflect that and can be better built to suit the needs of a more diverse group.
