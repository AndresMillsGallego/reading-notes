## NoSQL vs SQL[^1]

_So, What is the Difference?_

- SQL databases are relational, NoSQL are non-relational
- SQL are table based, while NoSQL are document based databases
- SQL have predefined schema, while NoSQL has dynamic schema
- SQL databases are vertically scaleable, where as NoSQL are horizontally scaleable

Good uses for SQL databases

- Complex query environments
- High transactional applications, heavy duty!

NoSql databases are a better fit for hierarchical data storage since it uses `key: value` pairs and is often viewed as the better choice for storing large data sets.  

In terms of support, either option _can_ be a good choice.  With SQL there is very often excellent support, while with NoSQL support can vary from database to database.

## SQL Modeling Techniques[^2]

SQL uses **relational tables** to build a database.
These are the some of the major elements which will be shown in the image below(per the attached article):

- The `Table Name`, which is located at the top of the table.
- The `Primary Keys`.  Remember the primary keys uniquely identify each row in a table.  A table typically has one primary key, but can have more.  When the key has more than one column, it is called a compound key.
- `Table Columns` – There can be one or more table columns.  To keep the diagrams simple, I don’t show the data types.  I may introduce those later when we focus on more comprehensive modeling.
- `Foreign Key` – This is a column or set of columns which match a primary key in another table.

We can connect tables also, this is what makes them relational.

- Zero, or One to Many
  - If there is one table (or in some cases a table with no entry ,hence the "0") connected to several other tables.
  > Notation:  `0..*` /  `1..*`
- Zero, or One to One
  - Same idea as above, but in this case the table is only connected to one table.
  > Notation: `0..1` / `1..1`
