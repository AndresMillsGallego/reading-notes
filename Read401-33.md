The **Definition**, per the article:

>"Role-based access control (RBAC) restricts network access based on a person's role within an organization and has become one of the main methods for advanced access control. The roles in RBAC refer to the levels of access that employees have to the network."

Some of the designations in RBAC can look like this:

- Management role scope – it limits what objects the role group is allowed to manage.
- Management role group – you can add and remove members.
- Management role – these are the types of tasks that can be performed by a specific role group.
- Management role assignment – this links a role to a role group.

Some of the benefits of implementing RBAC include:

1. Reducing administrative work and IT support.
2. Maximizing operational efficiency.
3. Improving Compliance.

Some of the best practices for implementing RBAC include:

- **Current Status:**
  - Create a list of every software, hardware and app that has some sort of security. For most of these things, it will be a password. However, you may also want to list server rooms that are under lock and key. Physical security can be a vital part of data protection. Also, list the status of who has access to all of these programs and areas. This will give you a snapshot of your current data scenario.
- **Current Roles:**
  - Even if you do not have a formal roster and list of roles, determining what each individual team member does may only take a little discussion. Try to organize the team in such a way that it doesn’t stifle creativity and the current culture (if enjoyed).
- **Write a Policy:**
  - Any changes made need to be written for all current and future employees to see. Even with the use of a RBAC tool, a document clearly articulating your new system will help avoid potential issues.
- **Make Changes:**
  - Once the current security status and roles are understood (not to mention a policy is written), it’s time to make the changes.
- **Continually Adapt:**
  - It’s likely that the first iteration of RBAC will require some tweaking. Early on, you should evaluate your roles and security status frequently. Assess first, how well the creative/production process is working and secondly, how secure your process happens to be.
