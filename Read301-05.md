- What is the single responsibility principle and how does it apply to components?
  - The single responsibility principle states that the item in question (component) should only do one thing.  If the componenent ends up growing it should be broken into sub-components.
- What does it mean to build a ‘static’ version of your application?
  - It means to build your app out so that it renders with the provided data, but without any interactivity.  
- Once you have a static application, what do you need to add?
  - Interactivity!  Or to be more specific, `state`!
- What are the three questions you can ask to determine if something is state?
  1. Is it passed from the parent via props?
  2. Does it remain unchanged over time?
  3. Can you compute it based on any other state or props in the component?
        - If answer is yes to these questions, then it is probably _not_ `state`.
- How can you identify where state needs to live?
  - We need to remember the one way data flow that React uses.  To determine where `state` needs to live we need to follow the path up.  It makes sense to have the `state` live in the parent component that is shared by the children components that need to access the data.

## Higher Order Functions[^2]

- What is a “higher-order function”?
  - A higher order function is a funcion that operates on other functions, often by either taking them as arguments, or by returning them.
- Explore the greaterThan function as defined in the reading. In your own words, what is line 2 of this function doing?
  - This returns a function where "m" is the element and the function returns a boolean based on if "m" is greater than "n" which is the argument passed into the original `greaterThan(n)` function
- Explain how either map or reduce operates, with regards to higher-order functions.
  - Both methods iterate through an array, then take an additional function as an argument.  By definition these methods are high order functions and can also be used themselves inside of other functions!
