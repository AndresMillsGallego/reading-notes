# Express REST API

## ES6 Classes[^1]

Defining a Class:
- Classes are really just special functions
- Classes can be defined just like a function, class expressions and class declarations.

To declare a class, you use the `class` keyword with the name of the class.

``` JavaScript
class Student {
  constructor(hungry, tired) {
    this.isHungry = hungry;
    this.isTired = tired;
  }
}
```
The `constructor` method is a neat way to create and instantiate an object with a `class`.  A `constructor` can use the `super` keyword to call the `constructor` of the `super` class ðŸ¤”ðŸ˜‰

Using the above class, we could make a new instance of the `Student` object like this:

``` JavaScript
let me = new Student('Yes, very', true)
console.log(me);
// {hungry: 'Yes, very',tired: true}
```
You can also add methods to classes, and make sub-classes with `extends` like so:

``` JavaScript
class Zombie extends Student {
  constructor(name) {
    super(name);
  }
  snack() {
    console.log(`${this.name} needs Braaaaaiiiiiiinsssss`)
  }
}
let me = new Zombie('Andres)
me.snack(); // Andres needs Braaaaaiiiiiiinsssss 
```

## Using Express Routing[^2]

Routing is essentially how an app's endpoints `respond` to their client `requests`
These routing methods are defined by using the `Express` app object and the corresponding HTTP methods which include:
- `GET`
  - Used to get/read/retrieve information
- `POST`
  - Used to create something by seding data in the `request.body`
- `PUT`
  - Used to update an existing item, found by it's id
- `DELETE`
  - Used to delete(or DESTROY ðŸ˜ˆ) an existing item, found by it's id

These methods can take a path and a callback function and can look something like this:

``` JavaScript
const express = require('express);
const app = express();

app.get('/', (request, response, next) => {
  response.send('How long till all Code Fellows students turn to zombies?')
})
```

Express 4.0 comes with the new `Router` which is like a mini-Express app

We instantiate `Router` and put it to work like this:

``` JavaScript
const router = express.Router();

router.get('/school/:class', (request, response, next) => {
  let class = request.params.class;
  response.send(`We are ${class}!!`)
})
router.get('/hungry', (request, response, next) => {
  response.send('We want Braaaaaiiiiiiiiinsssss')
})

router.get('/gone', (request, response, next) => {
  response.send('Sorry, all gone.  No brains for you')
})

module.exports = router;
```

The Express 4.0 `Router` gives us more flexibility than ever before in defining our routes.  
- Use `express.Router()` several times to define groups of routes
- You can apply the `express.Router()` to a section of your site by using `app.use`
- Use route middleware to process requests
- You can validate parameters using `.param()`
- Use `app.route()` as a shortcut to the `Router`
