## AWS, SNS and SQS[^1]

When to use `SNS` or `SQS`?

Technical Comparisson:

**S**imple **N**otification **S**ervice
- Publisher / Subscriber System
- Publishing messages can be delivered to MANY subscribers (fan out)

**S**imple **Q**ueue **S**ervice
- Queueing service for message processing
- A system must poll the Queue to discover these new events
- Messages in the queue are usually processed by a single client

_Do Other Systems Care About An Event?_

- SNS is the winner here!
  - You want to publish a message to your topic, and possibly tell others that this certain event happened.

_Does **Your System** Care About An Event?_

- SQS comes out on top in this one!
  -  Do you care about the message that is being received and about the event that happened?
