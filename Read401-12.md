## Web Sockets[^1]

_Web sockets, what are they?_

Per [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebSocket), a Web Socket is:
> "is a computer communications protocol, providing full-duplex communication channels over a single TCP connection."

The name "Web Socket", comes to us thanks to [Ian Hickson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ian_Hickson) and [Michael Carter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Carter_(entrepreneur))

Web Sockets were first discussed in 2008, and then finally put into place in 2011.

Code Example:

```JavaScript
// Creates new WebSocket object with a ws URI as the parameter
const socket = new WebSocket('ws://game.example.com:12010/updates');

// Fired when a connection with a WebSocket is opened,
socket.onopen = function () {
  setInterval(function() {
    if (socket.bufferedAmount == 0)
      socket.send(getUpdateData());
  }, 50);
};

// Fired when data is received through a WebSocket,
socket.onmessage = function(event) {
  handleUpdateData(event.data);
};

// Fired when a connection with a WebSocket is closed,
socket.onclose = function(event) {
  onSocketClose(event);
};

// Fired when a connection with a WebSocket has been closed because of an error,
socket.onerror = function(event) {
  onSocketError(event);
};
```

Web Sockets - Key Features

- WebSocket helps in real-time communication between the Client and the webserver.
- This protocol helps in transforming to cross-platform in a real-time world between the server and the client.
- This also enables the business worldwide for a real-time web application to enhance and increase the feasibility.
- The major advantage it stands over an HTTP connection that it provides full-duplex communication.

Socket.io - Key Features

- It helps in broadcasting to multiple sockets at a time and handles the connection transparently.
- It works on all platform, server or device, ensuring equality, reliability, and speed.
- It automatically upgrades the requirement to WebSocket if needed.
- It is a custom real-time transport protocol implementation on top of other protocols.
- It requires both libraries to be used Client side as well as a server-side library.
- IO works on work-based events. there are some reserved events that can be accessed using the Socket on the server side like Connect, message, Disconnect, Ping and Reconnect.
- There are some Client based reserved events like Connect, connect- error, connect-timeout and Reconnect etc.
