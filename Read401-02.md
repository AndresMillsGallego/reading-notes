## An Introduction to Node.js and Express[^1]

_What Is Node?_

Node.js is an open source, cross-platform runtime environment.  Basically it is a way for us to run JavaScript outside of the browser!
Node has a lot of great reasons to use it:
- Node offers great performance!
- The code is written in simple JavaScript making it easier and more seamless.
- The **N**ode **P**ackage **M**anager (`NPM`) provides access to thousands of reusable packages. 
- Node is portable!
- Node has an active developer community!

_What is Express?_

Express is the most popular Node framework and can do the following:

1. Write handlers and requests using HTTP verbs and URL paths (routes).
2. Set common web application settings, like the `PORT`!
3. Add additional request processing, or "middleware" at any point in the request handling pipeline.

Its not a popularity contest but........`Express` is a VERY popluar framework!  Why does this matter?  The more popular a framework is, the more likely it will be sticking around, get updated and have proper documentation!

We all know what they say about opinions....lucky for all of us `Express` doesn't have any ðŸ˜‚ (`Express` is considered an unopionated framework)

## What Is NPM?[^2]

`NPM` is the world's larget software registry.  Open source developers from all across the globe use it to share and borrow packages.

`NPM` consists of 3 distinct components:

1. The Website
2. The Command Line Interface(`CLI`)
3. The Registry

And....Some of the things you can use `NPM` for are:

-  Adapt packages of code fro your apps!
-  Download already built tools, ready to use!
-  Run packages without downloading, using `npx`
-  Restrict code to specific devs
-  Create organizations to coordinate various package needs
-  Update apps easily
-  Manage multiple versions of code and code dependincies
-  Find other devs who are working on the same, or similar, problems!

## What Is TDD?[^3]

Definition:
> **T**est **D**riven **D**evelopment is a style of programming in which three activities are interwoven:
>
> 1. Coding
> 2. Testing
> 3. Refactoring

`TDD` can also be described by these rules:

- Write a single test describing an aspect of the program
- Run the test, it will fail since the feature doesn't exist yet
- Write enough code, only just enough, to make the test pass
- Refactor the code until it conforms to [simplicity criteria](https://www.agilealliance.org/glossary/rules-of-simplicity/)
- Rinse and repeat, adding tests over time

Here are some benefits to `TDD`:
- Reported reductions in defect rates
- Can lead to improved design and higher quality internal, or technical code

And some potential risks:
- Forgetting to run tests frequently
- Writing **too** many tests at once
- Writing tests that are **too** large
- Writing tests for tirvial code

## CI/CD[^4]

**C**ontinuous **I**ntegration / **C**ontinuous **D**elivery

### CI and GitHub

As changes are made, these changes need to get to the server so that GitHub can review the changes, make sure they pass the tests, then complete the request! So how does this happen?

Key Terms:
- Web Hooks
  - Send messages to external systems about activity in your projects

These can be set to activate when someone tries to make a push, or makes a new PR.

### CD and Github

This works in a similar way actually. GitHub traks and communicates all these changes using Web Hooks and APIs!
