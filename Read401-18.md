_**What is Amazon API Gateway?**_

It is a managed service(like everything else in AWS) that allows developers to: 
- Define the `HTTP` endpoints of a REST API or a WebSocket API
- Connect those endpoints with a corresponding backend

API Gateway lives between the backend services of your API and your API's users.  It also provides a set of tools that can help you manage API definitions and mapping between endpoints and their backend services

_**How does API Gateway integrate with other AWS services?**_

Per the article:

> - AWS Lambda: run Lambda functions to generate HTTP API responses.
> - AWS SNS: publish SNS notifications when an HTTP API endpoint is accessed.
> - Amazon Cognito: provide authentication and authorization for your HTTP APIs.

Benefits to using API Gateway:

- Efficient API Development
- Easy Monitoring
- Performance At Any Scale
- Flexible Security Controls
- Cost Savings At Scale
- RESTful API Options

_**What is DynamoDB?**_

DynamoDB is a NoSQL database that is offered (and hosted) by **A**mazon **W**eb **S**ervices
It can offer:

- Reliable, scalable performance
- A managed experience
- A small, simple API

DynamoDB use cases:

- Apps with large amounts of data and strict latency requirements
- Serverless apps using AWS Lambda
- Data sets with simple, known access patterns

Dynamoose is a modeling tool for AWS's DynamoDB database. 
Dynamoose is heavily inspired by `mongoose`, which explains why it is so cool!

Here are some key features:

- Type safety
- High level API
- Easy to use syntax
- Ability to transform data _before_ saving or retrieving documents
- Strict data modeling
- Support for DynamoDB transactions
- Powerful conditional/filtering support
- `Callback` and `Promise` support
