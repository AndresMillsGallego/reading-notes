Me being the type of person that loves a good challenge, I am glad to see the pace of class steadily increase!  There is a lot more information coming at us now, and it is coming at us a lot quicker. We will all need to be mindful I think on absorbing as much as we can, but also accepting the fact that it will most likely be impossible for us to retain all of this new information.  
Not only is there a lot of _new_ information coming at us, but it is some very cool, ver interesting and seemingly very useful information. 

## HTML Links 

- Links are made in the HTML document with the `<a>` element
- The `<a>` element uses the  `href=` attribute to let the document knkow which page you are linking to.  
- You can link external pages (using URL's) 
  - or you can link to a page within your own site by using relative links

- You can also make a link that will open the user's email program and it will be set up with the desired email address! 
-  Last but not least, you can even link certain parts of your page by using the `id` attribute. 

As you can see links can be very useful and very fun to use in an HTML document. 

### CSS Layout

Phew!  This chapter was a doozie.  There is so much information in there I have a feeling I will be reading it several times.  Some of the information in there I already knew how to use, but I wasn't exactly sure on the _how_ it worked the way it did.  One of the things I love about CSS is that it is very much like an artist's palette, you can accomplish a lot through simple trial and error.  Learning on how and why certain properties do what they do is a whole other story however.

Like we learned in the last reading, any given wepage is made up of sections and boxes, though they aren't visible until we decided to make them that way with CSS.  In this chapter we started to learn a bit about the layout of a page, which properties can help with positioning particular `<div>` sections and how they can interact with one another based on the CSS properties that we use.  

Here are a few tidbits of information that stuck out in particular:

1. Designers often keep the width of a page at around 960px.  This is to ensure that it will remain visible and easily readable on a variety of devices and screens
2. Browsers will have a standard way to display content, however the author can specify `relative`, `absolute` or `fixed` positioning which will change the flow of the content. 
3. The `float` property!!  Before starting 201 I enjoyed playing around with this particular property.  When starting out it can be very useful, but also a bit finicky.  
4. You can make the site layout fixed width, or stretchy.  There are pros and cons to both, it is my personal opinion (so far at least) that somewhere in between the two is what is best. 
5.  You can include more than one CSS file on one page.  (We did this already with the "stylesheet" and "reset")
6. We also learned about CSS frameworks. We only learned a small amount, but my initial impression is that they could have their place possibly in a production setting, but you could also lose a lot of control.  I am reserving judgement till we can learn more.  

#### JavaScript Functions and Pair Programming

We didn't read too much on JS this week.  While the information that we did learn was not new to me, I was __extremely__ happy to read it!  I love functions and the logic that go into declaring and calling them.  
I also can't stand pop ups and prompts, so I am hopeful that moving forward we will be using less of those and more functions and event handlers.  

As for functions, they are essentially a list of instructions (or statemtents) that are put together with the goal of completeing a specific task.  The basic syntax of a function is as follows:

    function getHighFive() {
      alert('Yo! You get a high five!')
    }

To call a function, you just type the function name with parentheses at the end like so: `getHighFive()`

There is a lot more to them obviously, and I am sure we will dive farther in with future readings.  

I won't talk too much about "Pair Programming" other than to say it seems like a __very__ good idea!  The first thing I noticed in the reading was that it can get a bad rap, but honestly I am not sure why.  All of the reasons listed; efficiency, better learning, social skills, etc all seem fairly obvious to me.  Of course ideally you would want to get along with your partner, but aside from the potential issues if that is not the case, I see only real positives from working this way.

    If something is done faster, but with more errors...is it really...faster?
    Two heads are more often indeed better than one.
