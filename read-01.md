*__What is Markdown?__*

I am only just learning about Markdown myself, but already I am seeing the benefits and usefulness of this tool.  
So what is Markdown exactly?  It is a simple tool that can be used to make plain text easier to read, look better and be better organized.  

## Why Use Markdown?

* Its a great place to start due to how user friendly it is
* It can make your document not only easier to read, but have emphasis and emotion where it is needed
* Its a relatively quick way to get an idea or a piece of information down and shared on your page

### Ok, So How Do I Use it?

The syntax is fairly simple and easy to remember. 

If you want to use italics simply place a * or a _ at the start of your text
If you want to make something **BOLD**, just start the text with a ** or __
