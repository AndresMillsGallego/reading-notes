# React Lifestyle and React State vs Props

## React Lifestyle[^1]

![React Diagram](https://miro.medium.com/max/700/0*0saPKFiTUk6W3FYp)

- Based off the diagram, what happens first, the ‘render’ or the ‘componentDidMount’?
  - Based on the data flow, I would say that `render` happens first.
- What is the very first thing to happen in the lifecycle of React?
  - The constructor for the React app is called.
- Put the following things in the order that they happen: `componentDidMount`, `render`, `constructor`, `componentWillUnmount`, `React Updates`
  1. `constructor`
  2. `render`
  3. `componenetDidMount`
  4. `React Updates`
  5. `componentWillUnmount`

- What does componentDidMount do?
  - This is a method that is used to load something using a network request, or to initialize the DOM.  This method is invoked immediately after a component is mounted.

## React State vs Props[^2]

- What types of things can you pass in the props?
  - Props are the things that you might normally pass to a function. 
- What is the big difference between props and state?
  - `Props` are what are passed _into_ a component, `state` is handled, and updated _inside_ the component.
- When do we re-render our application?
  - The app will get re-rendered any time the `state` is changed.
- What are some examples of things that we could store in state?
  - Any data you want to be able to update and change based on user input and then re-render your app based on this changed data.
