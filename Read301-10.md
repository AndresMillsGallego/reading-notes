- What is a ‚Äòcall‚Äô?
  - A call is when a function(s) is invoked.
- How many ‚Äòcalls‚Äô can happen at once?
  - Funcions can be called one at a time, from top to bottom.
- What does LIFO mean?
  - **L**ast one **I**n, **F**irst one **O**ut.
- Draw an example of a call stack and the functions that would need to be invoked to generate that call stack.
- What causes a Stack Overflow?
  - When the maximum call size has been exceeded at which point an error will be thrown.

- What is a ‚Äòrefrence error‚Äô?
  - This happens when you attempt to use a variable that has not been defined.
- What is a ‚Äòsyntax error‚Äô?
  - As the name suggest, this is when the error lies in the syntax of the code.
- What is a ‚Äòrange error‚Äô?
  - This is often thrown when the "length" of an object or an array does not match what your code states.
- What is a ‚Äòtyep error‚Äô?
  - These are most common when trying to access a property that does not exist yet.  If the property does exist, but has no value it will still return as undefined, but without the type error (or 'tyep error as the assignment calls it üòÅ')
- What is a breakpoint?
  - A breakpoint is a stopping point put in by the dev for the purpose of debugging.
- What does the word ‚Äòdebugger‚Äô do in your code?
  - It allows us to see the history of our code up to the point that we implemented the `debugger` statement.
