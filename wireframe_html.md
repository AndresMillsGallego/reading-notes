# Wireframe

*__What is Wireframing?__*

Wireframing is a practice that UX designers use to plan out their their site, app or product.
Its similar to a story board, rough draft, etc etc. Its a way to get ideas down on paper and a basic layout going.

This proces can be done on a laptop or even a pen and paper!  While there are many great products out there, it can be a good idea to start things with a marker or a pen and a pad of paper or white board.
Remember that this process is about getting ideas down quick.  Detail and fine design can come later. Using paper and pen make it easy to fix mistakes without losing too much time.

It is still a good idea to have a plan when starting out.

__Steps to making a Wireframe__

    -Do your research! What are you going to be making?  Who is it going to be for? What is your user going to want to see?
    -Prepare and organize!  You are likely to gather a lot of information during your research.  Make sure it is stored and organized for later reference.
    -Map it out!  Make a plan for how you are going to lay out the architecture of this information.
    -Time to draw! Now that you have done the research, have it ready and accessible and made your plan...its time to draw it out!  Here is where you can start putting pen to paper. 
    -Test it out! Now that you have the beginnings of a wireframe you can start adding detail to it and getting something basic ready. It still doesnt need all the fine detail, but it should be ready to test out.  
    -Transition to prototype! After you have gotten some feedback from the initial round of testing its time to transition your product to a prototype and continue to iron out the details and continue with the testing process. 

*__What Makes a Good Wireframe?__*

The same things that make a good website or app, also make a good wireframe.

    1. Clarity - A good wireframe can help you visualize if your product is going to do what its supposed to.  It is a visual aid and should be as clear as possible.
    2. Confidence - Your product needs to be comfortable and make sense to the user.  If they lose confidence in the product then they are more likely to stop using the product. 
    3. Simplicity - You want your prodcut to look good without being too flashy. It needs to get the job done without being overly complicated.  

## HTML

*__What is HTML?__*

In essence HTML is the code that structures a web page.  It is the foundation of what makes up a web page.  

It stands for **H(hyper) T(text) M(markup) L(language)**

HTML is made up of things called elements.  An basic element has a set of tags (opening and closing) and the content which can be simple text, an image, a link, etc. The tags that are used to wrap the content can affect it by changing the font size, making it a link, adding emphasis and much more.
