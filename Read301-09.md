- What is functional programming?
  - Per Wikipedia, it is:  
  > a style of building the structure and elements of computer programs — that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing-state and mutable data.
- What is a pure function and how do we know if something is a pure function?
  - A function is pure if it returns the same result if given the same arguments without causing any observableside effects.  The code example given in the article was a great example of this.
- What are the benefits of a pure function?
  - If we know the expected output of a (pure)function, then it can be easier to test.
- What is immutability?
  - After something is created, it's state **cannot** be altered or changed.  Think of a `const` variable, you can change it's value and assign that value to a new variable, but you can't reassign the initial value.  
- What is Referential transparency?
  - Per the article: Basically, if a function consistently yields the same result for the same input, it is referentially transparent.
  > pure functions + immutable data = referential transparency

## Modules and require()[^2]

- What is a module?
  - A module is some functional `JavaScript` code that is kept in it's own `.js` file, like this one - `NapPlease.js`.
  > `let iNeedANap = function() {` <br>
    `return 'Sorry, no time to nap.  You have` `to code.'}`
- What does the word ‘require’ do?
  - `Require` is a global method in Node.js.
- How do we bring another module into the file the we are working in?
  - We pass the path to the file in string from into the `Require()` method. The path to the file does need the ".js" much like when passing components
  > `require('/NapPlease)`
- What do we have to do to make a module available?
  - We have to explicitly export the code we want to use, again, much like when passing components!  When we import, or _require_ a module we also need to save that into a variable so that we can use it.

    1. In the module page that you want to export:
    > `module-exports = NapPlease`
    2. In the module page where you want to import:
    > `let NapPlease = require(./NapPlease)`
