## Pre-Work Readings for 401

### Solving Problems[^1]

First off is our readings is this excellent article by John Somez on how to solve problems.  
> "Measure Twice and cut once!"

Have I heard this phrase? ðŸ˜‚ As someone who has been working with wood since I was a little kid, it is one of the first things my father ever taught me. This is one of the many methods that I am finding translate extremely well from construction into software development.  It makes sense if you think about it really, in both fields the worker is building something, something amazing that requires skill, patience and a healthy knowledge(and respect,) of the tools.  

These are the set of steps that the author details in the article, and I have to say I agree 100% with them.

1. Read the problem completely twice (Sometimes more than that, depending on the problem)
2. Solve the problem manually with 3 sets of sample data
3. Optimize the manual steps
4. Write the steps as pseudocode - we don't use pseudocode in construction obviously, but we do use the same step when building something especially complex!
5. Replace the pseudocode, or comments, with real code
6. Optimize the real code.

Honestly, the more I read this artice, the more I think that aspiring carpenters should read it as well!  Change out maybe a few key words and it would absolutely apply to the world of construction.

The author point out (and I agree,) that the first step is probably the most important one.  It can all go horribly wrong before you even get started if not enough care is given to this step.  
I also think it is worth mentioning that the last step is also important.  We want our solutions to work, but I believe that we should never settle there.  Sure, getting it to work is great, but getting it to work _optimally_ should be the end goal.

(Note:  Unfotunately this [link](https://medium.com/swlh/pretend-your-time-is-worth-1-000-hour-and-youll-become-100x-more-productive-f04628bb3e6d) was broken so I could not read the article "Act Like You Make $1000/hr" )

### How To Think Like A Programmer[^2]

Programming is all about problem solving, and the better one is at problem solving, the better they are at programming. Not to bring this around back to construction again, but the similarites between the two fields are astounding.  Solving the problem is the first thing, but the next thing that comes up right after that is _how_ you solve the problem.  In programming, and definitely in construction, how you solve a given problem has a huge impact on the quality of the product, and how profitable it is. 

The author lists these key steps in his framework to attack a problem:

1. **Understand** - Make sure you know what the problem even is **before** you attempt to solve it.  
2. **Plan** - Don't dive in all gung ho even _after_ you do understand it.  Make a plan first so that you feel confident you are attacking the problem the best way you can.
3. **Divide** - Don't try to solve it all in one fell swoop, break it down into smaller problems.  This can often make the problem seem far less intimidating and overwhelming.
4. **Stuck?** - We all get stuck at some point!  I think taking a break, maybe even getting up and walking around a bit can do wonders.  Then, try to debug your code, and sometimes...just nuke it and start all over.  This is situational and shouldn't always be done of course.
5. **Practice** - Practice, practice, practice.  You won't be an expert right off the bat, but the goal should be to get a little better each time you attempt a problem.  This progress won't be linear at all times, but even failures lead to valuable experience.

### The 5 Whys[^3]

_What is the 5 Whys technique?_

Sakichi Toyoda, industrialist, inventor and founder of Toyota Industries developed the `5 Whys Technique` in the 1930s.

_How to use it?_

1. **Assemble a Team** - Get a team of people together who are familiar with the details of the problem.
2. **Define the Problem** - If possible, observe the problem in action!  Go over the problem with your team and come up with a statement that describes the problem.
3. **Ask the first "Why"** - Ask the question, "why is this problem occuring?" It sounds simple enough, but sometimes answering this question takes some serious thought.  When coming up with answers make sure they are based in fact.
4. **Ask "Why" Four More Times** - For each answer that the previous step generated, ask four more "whys" in succession.  It should look something like this:

5. **Know when to stop** - You will know when to stop, when the answers to your "whys" stop producing useful responses.  At this point, it is not useful to go further.
6. **Address the Root Cause(s)** - Now that the cause(s) have been identified, it's time to agree on the solutions to keep the problem from reoccurring.
7. **Monitor your measures** - Keep a close eye on just how effective your counter measures are working.
