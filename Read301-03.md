# React Docs, The Spread Operator and How To Pass Functions Between Components

## React Docs - Lists and Keys[^1]

- What does .map() return?
    - `.map()` returns a new array of values provided by calling a function to the values in an existing array.
- If I want to loop through an array and display each value in 
JSX, how do I do that in React?
    - We use `.map()` the same way, the only difference being we use our function to return an html element with the data inside the element contained in curly braces.
- Each list item needs a unique ____.
    - "key"
- What is the purpose of a key?
    - Keys exist so that each item can have an identity, that way React can keep track of each item and any changes that may affect the item.

## The Spread Operator[^2]

- What is the spread operator?
    - Essentially the `...` operator expands an iterable object into a separate list of arguments
- List 4 things that the spread operator can do.
    1. Add items to an array.
    2. Combining arrays (or objects).
    3. Spreading an array out into a function's arguments.
    4. Using `Math.etc()` functions (since `...` does that^^).

- Give an example of using the spread operator to combine two arrays.
    - > `let array1 = [1, 2, 3];` <br>
      > `let array2 = [4, 5, 6];` <br>
      > `let combinedArray = [...array1, ...array2];`

- Give an example of using the spread operator to add a new item to an array.
    - > `let arrayA = ['c', 'd', 'e'];`
    - > `let betterArray = ['a', 'b', ...arrayA];`
    
- Give an example of using the spread operator to combine two objects into one.

## How to Pass Functions Between Components[^3]

- In the video, what is the first step that the developer does to pass functions between components?
- In your own words, what does the `increment` function do?
- How can you pass a method from a parent component into a child component?
- How does the child component invoke a method that was passed to it from a parent component?
