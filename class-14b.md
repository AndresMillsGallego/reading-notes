# What Google From Its Quest to Build the Perfect Team

I absolutely loved this [article!](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/28/magazine/what-google-learned-from-its-quest-to-build-the-perfect-team.html)  What does make a great team?  Its one of those things that are often easy to spot, but not so easy to reproduce.  What goes into making a team thrive, not just in terms of efficiency at work, but emotionally as well?  There was one term that was repeated throughout the article and it stuck with me: **Psychological Safety**.

If you think about it, it all makes sense.  If you work on a puzzle, each piece has to fit, has to have a use and a purpose to work.  If the piece does not fit, there is a problem.  If there is a piece missing, there is a problem and the puzzle remains incomplete.  What Google discovered was that the individual pieces didn't matter, or rather, they weren't the _only_ thing that mattered.  It was how they all fit together that made a great team.  

I use the term "discovered" loosely, as the article points out, this is not earth shattering news to many managers.  

While it is true that life is not so simple, or black and white most of the time, I often lean back on two simple ideas on how to live my life.  

> 1. Don't be a jerk.
> 2. What is good for _everyone_ is also good for _me_.

We are a community and so everything that happens to our community, affects us as well, even if not directly.  With so much of our work moving towards teams it makes sense to build the best teams we can.  Not just for the employer's sake, or for the bottom line.  We should strive for this to make our experience as workers more enjoyable and fulfilling.  We all spend a good portion of our lives working, it should be as positive an experience  as we can make it.  

We are all human beings after all, and we need to remember this and not lose our humanity when we clock in.
