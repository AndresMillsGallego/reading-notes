## What does `Array.map()` do?

![Map](https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcTodwN2DSF5IEduKiawe44CS48D7-dxRSQSmQ&usqp=CAU)

- `.map()` is an array method that takes a callback function and returns a _new_ array based on the results of said callback function on each element of the array.

## What does `Array.reduce()` do?

![Reduce](https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcQGV9eDbPHOQ3ioYl2S6MK4d_b1DvaHHvO0GA&usqp=CAU)

- `.reduce()` passes a callback, "reducer" function on each element in an array.  What gets returned is a single value which can be any data type.  It takes an `initial value`, an `existing value` and a `return value` as parameters for the callback function.

## `Superagent()`

- Promise `.then()`

> `superagent.post('/api/pet').then(console.log).catch(console.error);`

- `async` / `await`

> `(async () => {` <br>
> `try {` <br>
> `const res = await superagent.post('/api/pet');`
> `console.log(res);`
> `}` <br>
> `catch (err) {`
> `console.error(err);`
> `}` <br>
>`})();`

## Explain JavaScript Promises

![Promise](https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcR1XEed45Pk5FzydMnPVv8D03BFVgqy4cKorQ&usqp=CAU)

- A JavaScript promise, is actually a lot like a normal promise.  It is made on the premise, or assumption that it will be fulfilled or rejected.  If neither has happened yet, then the promise is pending (in a state of limbo till it gets fulfilled or rejected).  If it is fulfilled, then the promise returns a value based on the initial promise, or if it is rejected, then an error is returned instead.

## Are all callback functions considered to be Asynchronous? Why or Why Not?

- Callback functions can be synchronous, _or_ asynchronous, so I think the answer to this particular question is no, they are not.

Check out these two diagrams below (from the linked article) that explain it very well.
