- `Queues` - buffers between producers and consumers
- AWS provides a Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS)
  - These queues are versatile and elastic, but there are times when duplicate messages are received, or messages can arrive out of order
- An Amazon SQS `FIFO` queue is not as scalable, but the messages will not be duplicated and will arrive in order

- Pub/Sub Messaging
  - Amazon **S**imple **N**otification **S**ervice
  - A publisher sends out the same message to multiple clients


## AWS SQS vs SNS[^2]

`SNS` is a distributed **publish-subscribe** service

`SQS` is a distributed **queueing** service

Key Differences:

- Message Consumption
  - `SQS` - Pull mechanism, consumers poll messages from SQS
  - `SNS` - Push mechanism, SNS pushes messages to consumers

- Persistence
  - `SQS` - No persistence.  If no consumer is available at the time of arrival then the message is lost 
  - `SNS` - Messages are persisted for some duration.  The retention period value is from 1 minute to 14 days with the default being 4 days
  - In `SQS` the message delivery is guaranteed, in `SNS` it is not

- Consumer Type
  - `SQS` - All the consumers are meant to be identical, the messages are all processed the same way
  - `SNS` - All the consumers are meant to process the messages in different ways
