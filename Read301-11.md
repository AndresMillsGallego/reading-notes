## NoSQL vs SQL[^1]

|   SQL | NoSQL |
| :---: | :---: |
| Table Based| Documnent Based |
| Predefined Schema| Dynamic Schema|
| Vertically Scalable| Horizontaly Scalable|
| Relational Database| Non-Relational Database|

- What kind of data is a good fit for an SQL database?
  - Data that relies on, or needs complex queries.
- Give a real world example.
- What kind of data is a good fit a NoSQL database?
  - 
- Give a real world example.
- Which type of database is best for hierarchical data storage?
  - NoSQL is a better fit for hierarchical data storage
- Which type of database is best for scalability?
  - I would say NoSQL is probably the better option since horizontal scaling is possible and thus more versatile.

- What does SQL stand for?
  - Structured Query Language.
- What is a relational database?
  - It is a database that works in a particular, or a certain way.
- What type of structure does a relational database work with?
  - Tables
- What is a ‘schema’?
  - The requirements in which way the database is built and organized.
- What is a NoSQL database?
  - Stands for "**N**ot **O**nly **SQL** and is a non-tabular database.
- How does it work?
  - They are built to store a lot of data in a efficient way.
- What is inside of a Mongo database?
  - It stores "collections" and these "collections", store "documents".  Inside the documents there is no schema, so each documents can have different data structures.
- Which is more flexible - SQL or MongoDB? and why.
  - I would say MongoDB is the more flexible option since the same strict schema that SQL uses is not required in MongoDB.
- What is the disadvantage of a NoSQL database?
  - You can end up with duplicate data, or the need to update data in multiple places due to the number of documents stored in each collection.
