## Making Sense of Hooks[^1]

_**Why Hooks?**_

Traditional components are great and offer many benefits, but they can also leave us with a few potential problems:

1. Huge components that are hard to refactor and test.
2. Duplicated logic between different components and lifecycle methods.
3. Complex patterns like render props and higher-order components.

Using Hooks can be the solution to these 3 problems, per the author:

> "Hooks apply the React philosophy (explicit data flow and composition) inside a component, rather than just between the components. That’s why I feel that Hooks are a natural fit for the React component model."

A few key points in favor of implementing Hooks:

1. If the React community embraces the Hooks proposal, it will reduce the number of concepts you need to juggle when writing React applications.
2. The Hooks proposal doesn’t include any breaking changes. Your existing code would keep on working even if you adopted Hooks in the newly written components.
3. Since Hooks are regular JavaScript functions, you can combine built-in Hooks provided by React into your own “custom Hooks”.

_**So What About State?**_

To use state there are built in hooks like `useState` and `useEffect`.  See [HERE](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-overview.html) for more documentation

## The State Hook[^2]

Still wondering how we use and change state with Hooks?  Check out the code example below:

```JavaScript
  import React, { useState } from 'react';

function Example() {
  // Declare a new state variable, which we'll call "count"
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  return (
    <div>
      <p>You clicked {count} times</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>
        Click me
      </button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

- What is a Hook?
  - A Hook is a special function that lets you “hook into” React features. For example, useState is a Hook that lets you add React state to function components. We’ll learn other Hooks later.

- When would I use a Hook?
  - If you write a function component and realize you need to add some state to it, previously you had to convert it to a class. Now you can use a Hook inside the existing function component.

Sounds fun right?  And it may seem like the wild west, but there are some [RULES](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-rules.html) that apply when using Hooks.

A bit more on the `useState` built in Hook, per the article:

- What does calling `useState` do?
  - It declares a “state variable”. Our variable is called `count` but we could call it anything else, like banana. This is a way to “preserve” some values between the function calls — `useState` is a new way to use the exact same capabilities that `this.state` provides in a class. Normally, variables “disappear” when the function exits but state variables are preserved by React.

- What do we pass to `useState` as an argument?
  - The only argument to the `useState()` Hook is the initial state. Unlike with classes, the state doesn’t have to be an object. We can keep a number or a string if that’s all we need. In our example, we just want a number for how many times the user clicked, so pass 0 as initial state for our variable. (If we wanted to store two different values in state, we would call `useState()` twice.)

- What does `useState` return?
  - It returns a pair of values: the current state and a function that updates it. This is why we write `const [count, setCount] = useState()`. This is similar to this.state.count and this.setState in a class, except you get them in a pair. If you’re not familiar with the syntax we used, we’ll come back to it at the bottom of this page.
