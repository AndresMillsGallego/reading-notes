# Redux - Asynchronous Actions

## Async Actions[^1]

So far our work implementing `React` and `Redux` has allowed them to play nicely together.  All of the data that we have been working in has been stored and available locally making it easy to access and use.

There will be times, (almost always), where we will need to work with data from a server using `HTTP` requests

We can make these requests in our `React`+`Redux` applications, but we need to use middelware to make sure our async functions behave properly. 

Here is a sample of one way to implement middleware via the article:

```Javascript
  const asyncFunctionMiddleware = storeAPI => next => action => {
  // If the "action" is actually a function instead...
  if (typeof action === 'function') {
    // then call the function and pass `dispatch` and `getState` as arguments
    return action(storeAPI.dispatch, storeAPI.getState)
  }

  // Otherwise, it's a normal action - send it onwards
  return next(action)
}
```

## Redux Thunk[^2]

Seem complicated?  Wish their was already something that took care of this?  You are in luck!  

`Redux` already thought of this and has their own version of async function middleware.  The best part about all of this?

This specatular product is called `THUNK` üòÅ

I think it is a good idea to learn to write this code as the knowledge is valuable, but the built in `THUNK` could be a good tool to get something up and running quickly.

First step:

```JavaScript
npm install redux-thunk
```

Then, once you have it installed you can update your `store` to use it as middleware:

```JavaScript
import { createStore, applyMiddleware } from 'redux'
import thunkMiddleware from 'redux-thunk'
import { composeWithDevTools } from 'redux-devtools-extension'
import rootReducer from './reducer'

const composedEnhancer = composeWithDevTools(applyMiddleware(thunkMiddleware))

// The store now has the ability to accept thunk functions in `dispatch`
const store = createStore(rootReducer, composedEnhancer)
export default store
```
