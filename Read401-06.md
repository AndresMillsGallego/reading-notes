## Securing Passwords[^1]

Passwords are what we use to keep our data safe!  They are our first line of defense, kind of like a secret knock.  Remember those old movies where after knocking a low voice behind the door would mutter....
> "What's the password?"

If you didn't answer correctly, no dice, you were not getting in.  That is how we passwords online as well!

One way we accomplish this is with cryptographic hash algorithms.  These work great, but aren't perfect.  They can be suscptible to:
- Brute Force Attacks
  - Hash funcions are designed for speed and can be vulnerable. A modern computer can hack a [16 Character Strong Password](https://thehackernews.com/2013/05/cracking-16-character-strong-passwords.html) in less than an hour
- Hash Collision Attacks
  - There exists the possibility that two different inputs could produce the same hash, so an attacker could, using a word list, crack the hashes

This is where `Bcrypt` comes in.  As the author states, "It's slow, and strong as hell".

To overcome the issues described above, `Bcrypt` uses a technique called [Key Stretching](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_stretching).  

## Basic Auth[^2]

Per the wiki page(link in the footnotes):

> "**Basic Access Authentication** is a method for an HTTP user agent (e.g. a web browser), to provide a user name and password when making a request.

> " In basic HTTP authentication, a request contains a header field in the form of `Authorization: Basic <credentials>`, where credentials is the Base64 encoding of ID and password joined by a single colon :."

It was originally implemented by [Ari Luotonene](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ari_Luotonen) at CERN in 1993.

## OWASP Auth Cheatsheet[^3]

- **Authentication** - The process of verifying that an individual, entity or website is whom it claims to be.

- **Session Management** - A process by which a server maintains the state of an entity interacting with it.

|Authentication General Guidelines|
|:---:|
|Make Sure User Ids are case sensitive|
|Implement Proper Password Strength Controls|
|Implement Secure Password Recovery Mechanism|
|Store Passwords In A Secure Fashion|
|Compare Password Hashes Using Safe Functions|
|Transmit Passwords Only Over TLS or OTher Strong Transport|
|Require Re-authorization For Sensitive Features|
|Consider [Strong Transaction Authentication](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Transaction_Authorization_Cheat_Sheet.html)|

_**MMMMMMMM......Hash + Salt**_

![Hash](https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcRAWGfmVs0JNR_rDukJ_hGZxQlKQqiGqItEMw&usqp=CAU)

Here are a few code examples to get started with `Bcrypt`.  Read further by following the link in the footnotes.

Usage:

async(recommended)
``` JavaScript
const bcrypt = require('bcrypt');
const saltRounds = 10;
const myPlaintextPassword = 's0/\/\P4$$w0rD';
const someOtherPlaintextPassword = 'not_bacon';
```

To `hash` a password:

```JavaScript
bcrypt.genSalt(saltRounds, function(err, salt) {
    bcrypt.hash(myPlaintextPassword, salt, function(err, hash) {
        // Store hash in your password DB.
    });
});
```

To check a password:

```JavaScript
// Load hash from your password DB.
bcrypt.compare(myPlaintextPassword, hash, function(err, result) {
    // result == true
});
bcrypt.compare(someOtherPlaintextPassword, hash, function(err, result) {
    // result == false
});
```
