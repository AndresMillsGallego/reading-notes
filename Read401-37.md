_**Why Combine?**_

Reducers are great and work well in Redux, but in a real world application you are going to need more than one, otherwise your app could lack functionality, or you could end up with one.....big.....GIANT....reducer!!!(duh, duh, duuuuhhhhhhhh)

It makes sense to have several reducers, each responsible for their own job.  This is inline with `React`'s "atomic" architecture and keeps each reducer responsible for their own functionality.  

By combining them, we can draw from each reducer in our `Redux` "store" and even have each one "listen" for the same event.  

There are a few guidelines that you will want to follow when using `combineReducers()`:

- For any action that is not recognized, it must return the state given to it as the first argument.

- It must never return undefined. It is too easy to do this by mistake via an early return statement, so combineReducers throws if you do that instead of letting the error manifest itself somewhere else.

- If the state given to it is undefined, it must return the initial state for this specific reducer. According to the previous rule, the initial state must not be undefined either. It is handy to specify it with ES6 optional arguments syntax, but you can also explicitly check the first argument for being undefined.

Here is an example of a reducer that increments a counter which is stored in state:

```JavaScript
  export default function counter(state = 0, action) {
  switch (action.type) {
    case 'INCREMENT':
      return state + 1
    case 'DECREMENT':
      return state - 1
    default:
      return state
  }
}
```

And here is an example of another reducer that adds an item to the `todo` property, again stored in state:

```JavaScript
  export default function todos(state = [], action) {
  switch (action.type) {
    case 'ADD_TODO':
      return state.concat([action.text])
    default:
      return state
  }
}
```

Finally, here is an example where we combine both reducers using `combineReducers()`:

```JavaScript
  import { combineReducers } from 'redux'
  import todos from './todos'
  import counter from './counter'

  export default combineReducers({
    todos,
    counter
})
```
