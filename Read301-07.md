- Who is Roy Fielding?
  - Word on the street is he is some guy who is smart.  To be more specific, he helped to write the first web servers.
- Why donâ€™t the techniques that we use today work well when we need to be able to talk to all of the machines in the world?
  - They were not built like that originally.  At first the idea was to be able to talk to a small number of machines, not all of them.
- What is the HTTP protocol that Fielding and his friends created?
  - As the article points out, essentially the protocol applies verbs to nouns.  Essentially, regardelss of what the "noun" is, the same verb, in this case "get" is used to "get" them.
- What does a GET do?
  - A `GET` is used by one machine to retrieve information from another.
- What does a POST do?
  - A `POST` is used when one system needs to add something to another system.
- What does PUT do?
  - A `PUT` is used when a system wants to repace something in another system.
- What does PATCH do?
  - A `PATCH` is similar to a `PUT`, but is used when the system wants only do a partial update.
