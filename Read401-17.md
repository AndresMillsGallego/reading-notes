## AWS S3[^1]

_**How it works**_

Amazon Simple Storage Service(Amazon S3) is an object storage service offering:
- Industry leading scalability
- Data availability
- Security
- Performance

_**What is AWS Lambda?**_

> "AWS Lambda is a serverless computing service provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS)."

- Users can create functions and self-contained apps.  
- "serverless" doen't mean no servers, it just means that _you_ don't need to have any servers!  AWS provides and maintains all of that with their service

_**How does it work?**_

- Each `Lambda` function runs in it's own container
- When a function is created, Lambda packages it up in a new container.
- Before the function starts running, each function's container is given the necessary RAM and CPU capacity
- Once the function stops running, the allocated RAM is multiplied by the amount of time the function spent running.  This is how the customer is billed

_**Why is AWS Lambda an essential part of the Serverless architecture?**_

Since Lambda is "serverless", you will not need, (or rather Lambda will provide):

- a computing service
- a database service
- an `HTTP` gateway service

_**What are the most common use cases for AWS Lambda?**_

1. individual tasks run for a short time
2. each task is generally self-contained
3. there is a large difference between the lowest and highest levels in the workload application

## AWS Lambda Functions[^3]

Three examples of "How it works"

## CDN[^4]

_**What is a CDN?**_

A `CDN`, or **C**ontent **D**elivery **N**etwork, is: 

> "a geographically distributed group of servers that work together to provide fast delivery of internet content."

- CDNs work through servers that are located nearest to the website visitor 
- The content delivery network copies the pages of a website to a network of servers that are spread out geographically
- The contents of the copied pages are cached
- When a user requests a webpage, the CDN redirects the request from the originating server, to the server that is closest to the user and has the cached content
- Employing a CDN speeds up the delivery of the content, and it also helps protect against certain cyber attacks.
