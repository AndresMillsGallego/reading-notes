## Redux Tutorials[^1]

In this reading, the creator of `Redux` - Dan Abramov gives us an indepth tutorial on everything to do with `Redux`!

Per the artice: 
- >"...State management is absolutely critical in providing users with a well-crafted experience with minimal bugs. <br>
...It's also one of the hardest aspects of a modern front-end application to get right."

So how does `Redux` help us with this?

`Redux` provides:

- A solid, stable and mature solution to managing state in a React application.
- Through a handful of small and useful patterns, `Redux` can help to transform your app from scattered and disorganized, to clean, organized and easy to understand!
- The principles aren't necessarily new, but they _are_ packaged in an easy to use, and easy to understand library.

Here is a bit of my own code that I have in one of my apps that showcases using `Redux` stores:

```JavaScript
  const productReducer = (state = initialState, action) => {

  switch (action.type) {
    case 'funkoPops':
      return {
        ...state,
        filteredProducts: state.products.filter(product => 
          product.category === 'funkoPops')
      }
    case 'gpk':
      return {
        ...state,
        filteredProducts: state.products.filter(product => product.category === 'gpks')
      }
    case 'reset':
      return {
        ...state,
        filteredProducts: []
      }
    default:
      return state
  }
}

export const filterProducts = (category) => {
  if (category === 'funkoPops') {
    return {
      type: 'funkoPops',
      payload: category
    }
  } else {
    return {
      type: 'gpk', 
      payload: category
    }
  }
}
```
