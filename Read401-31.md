# Context API

## Context API[^1]

_**What is it?**_

Per the docs:

> "Context provides a way to pass data through the component tree without having to pass props down manually at every level."

I don't know about you, but I think this sounds amazing! 😍

The docs go on: 

> "In a typical React application, data is passed top-down (parent to child) via props, but such usage can be cumbersome for certain types of props (e.g. locale preference, UI theme) that are required by many components within an application. Context provides a way to share values like these between components without having to explicitly pass a prop through every level of the tree."

I love the idea of top down architecture, but this is already sounding a lot better to me.  

_When to use it?_

While bypassing the strict "top down" system sounds quicker and more efficient, it isn't always the move.  Context is designed to share data that is considered "global".  This makes a lot of sense, and explains why React made the use of Context a thing.  

Having said all that, `Context` is mainly used when data needs to made accessible to _many_ components at different levels.  While this can be a good thing, it can also make component reuse more difficult, so it should be used sparingly.

Here are a few code snippets of how to use `Context`

React.createContext
```Javascript
  const MyContext = React.createContext(defaultValue);
```

Context.Provider
```Javascript
  <MyContext.Provider value={/* some value */}>
```

Context.Consumer
```Javascript
  <MyContext.Consumer>
  {value => /* render something based on the context value */}
</MyContext.Consumer>
```

Class.contextType
```Javascript
  class MyClass extends React.Component {
  componentDidMount() {
    let value = this.context;
    /* perform a side-effect at mount using the value of MyContext */
  }
  componentDidUpdate() {
    let value = this.context;
    /* ... */
  }
  componentWillUnmount() {
    let value = this.context;
    /* ... */
  }
  render() {
    let value = this.context;
    /* render something based on the value of MyContext */
  }
}
MyClass.contextType = MyContext;
```

## Hooks And Context Example[^2]

The example given in this article are "snackbars", which are small notifications that appear on the screen when a user performs a certain action.

`Context` can be a perfect use for these cases. 

Here is an excellent example of using `Context` to achieve this:

```javascript
export const SnackBarContext = createContext()

const AUTO_DISMISS = 5000

export function SnackBarProvider({ children }) {
  const [alerts, setAlerts] = useState([])
  
  const activeAlertIds = alerts.join(',')
  useEffect(() => {
    if (activeAlertIds.length > 0) {
      const timer = setTimeout(() => setAlerts((alerts) => alerts.slice(0, alerts.length - 1)), AUTO_DISMISS)
      return () => clearTimeout(timer)
    }
  }, [activeAlertIds])

  const addAlert = (alert) => setAlerts((alerts) => [alert, ...alerts])

  const value = { addAlert }
    
  return (
    <SnackBarContext.Provider value={value}>
      {children}
      {alerts.map((alert) => <SnackBar key={alert}>{alert}</SnackBar>)}
    </SnackBarContext.Provider>
  )
}
```
