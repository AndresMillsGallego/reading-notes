## AWS EC2[^1]

_**What does it do?**_

- Access reliable, scalable infrastructure on demand.  Scale capacity within minutes with SLA commitment of 99.99% availability

## EC2 For Humans[^2]

As the video points out, the EC2 dashboard can look a bit overwhelming, here is a bit of information on initial set up.

1.  Choose an Amazon Machine Image
2.  Selecting an instance type
    - `t` stands for burst where you can earn burst credits during times when there is not much traffic on your site.
    - `m` stands for multi-purpose
    - `c` stands for compute
3.  Configure instance details
4.  Add storage
5.  Add tags
6.  Configure security group
    - Create a new group
    - Select an existing group
7.  Review and launch instance!

First off, I have to say this is a very effective advertisement!

The basic gist of it all, is that by using Elastic Beanstalk, one can stay busy designing and building the application without spending a ton of time managing the infrastructure.  

Elastic Beanstalk does all of that for you!  It doesn't "cost" anything extra, though don't worry, you will be paying for any AWS service that you end up using.
