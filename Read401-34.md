1. How do bearer tokens work?
  - > "The Bearer Token is created for you by the Authentication server. When a user authenticates your application (client) the authentication server then goes and generates for you a Token. Bearer Tokens are the predominant type of access token used with OAuth 2.0. A Bearer token basically says “Give the bearer of this token access”." [^1]

2. Describe express middleware
  - `Express` on its own is fairly lightweight.[^2]  An `Express` app is essentially just a collection of middleware functions.
  - Middleware functions are functions that have access to the request object (req), the response object (res), and the next middleware function in the application’s request-response cycle. The next middleware function is commonly denoted by a variable named next.
  - Middleware functions can perform the following tasks:
    - Execute any code.
    - Make changes to the request and the response objects.
    - End the request-response cycle.
    - Call the next middleware function in the stack.

3. What is a JWT?
  - First off, it stands for **J**SON **W**eb **T**oken
  - > "JSON Web Token (JWT) is an open standard (RFC 7519) that defines a compact and self-contained way for securely transmitting information between parties as a JSON object. This information can be verified and trusted because it is digitally signed. JWTs can be signed using a secret (with the HMAC algorithm) or a public/private key pair using RSA or ECDSA." [^3]

- **R**ole **B**ased **A**ccess **C**ontrol (RBAC)
  - Roles are created to allow access to appropriate content, and when applicable, permission to update/delete data as well.
  - Three primary rules are defined for RBAC:[^4]

    1. Role assignment: A subject can exercise a permission only if the subject has selected or been assigned a role.
    2. Role authorization: A subject's active role must be authorized for the subject. With rule 1 above, this rule ensures that users can take on only roles for which they are authorized.
    3. Permission authorization: A subject can exercise a permission only if the permission is authorized for the subject's active role. With rules 1 and 2, this rule ensures that users can exercise only permissions for which they are authorized.

- `HTTP` cookies
  - > "An HTTP cookie (web cookie, browser cookie) is a small piece of data that a server sends to a user's web browser. The browser may store the cookie and send it back to the same server with later requests. Typically, an HTTP cookie is used to tell if two requests come from the same browser—keeping a user logged in, for example. It remembers stateful information for the stateless HTTP protocol." [^5]
  - Cookies are mainly used for three purposes:
    1. Session management
    Logins, shopping carts, game scores, or anything else the server should remember

    2. Personalization
    User preferences, themes, and other settings

    3. Tracking
    Recording and analyzing user behavior
