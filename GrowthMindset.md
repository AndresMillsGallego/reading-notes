# The Growth Mindset

_Growth mindset is something that I constantly strive for.  For me the key word is **growth**.  If one has the desire, the drive, and the dedication then almost anything is possible._

It is very easy to fall into a fixed mindset as it is often the easier, more comfortable place to be.  
All one has to do is look at human history to see that almost anything is possible. I believe that talent exists, but even that can only take us so far.  We have to be open minded, open to change and not only willing to fail...but we have to embrace that uncomfortable feeling as that is where we learn and how we build.  

## Three reminders that I use to stay in a Growth Mindset.

1. Remember to welcome a challenge
2. Failure is how we learn and how we grow.  It is ok to fail as long as we learn from it. 
3. Never settle, always be looking to improve and to learn more.
