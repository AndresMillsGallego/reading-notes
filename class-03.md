# HTML Lists and CSS Boxes....oh my!

For todays reading we learned about lists (or arrays) in HTML as well as boxes in CSS, what they are and what we can do with them.  

**A quick rundown of what we learned**

- We use three types of lists in HTML
  
  1. Ordered Lists (These use numbers)
  - Unordered Lists (These use bullets)
  
- and,  Definition Lists which as the name implies are used to define items on the page. 

_**Fun Fact**_
- Lists can be.....
  - nested inside.....
    1. one another! 

## CSS Boxes

CSS actually looks at each HTML element as if it were in a box, even if the user can't see one!  The fact that these boxes exist (If there is a box in the woods and CSS can't see it does it even exist?) means that we can control how they act.  We can control the dimensions, margins, spacing, colors, etc.  We can even add color to the "invisible" border to make it visible.  
Since CSS is the king/queen of style we can not only control the dimensions and such, but we can make them look goooooood too. Things like rounded corners, geometric shapes, etc are some of the fun things that we can do with these boxes using CSS.  Looking good can _also_ make the content on the page easier to read which can be extremely useful and beneficial to the user. 

### JavaScript Arrays, Decisions, Loops, Ifs, Elses (No buts though?)

JS Array - these are essentially containers that hold lists of values.  These can be extremely useful especially when learning to navigate loops and conditional statements.  

_**So what are those exactly?**_

Conditional statements are what we often use to make a decision on which path our code should take.  We use comparison operators like those found below:

`===, !==, <, >, <=`

Think of the conditional statement as making a choice, to instruct the computer on _how_ to make that choice we use these operators.
With `If....else` statements think of them like a on/off switch where the condition being `True` will run one set of code, and it being `False` will run another. Remember that all values will return as truthy or falsey, be careful though...the returned value is not always what you will expect.  

If you want to iterate through a set of values, then loops are your friends.  
There are three types of loops:
  1. `For` Loops
  2.  `While` Loops
  3. `Do...While` Loops

We will be learning more about these loops and how to best utilize them in the upcoming classes.
