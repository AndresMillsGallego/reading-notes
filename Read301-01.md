- Components are software objects that are made with the intent of interacting with other components.
- Components are portable, replaceable and reuasble.  All qualities which can make them advantageous to use.
- As stated in the article, "A software component can be defined as a unit of composition with a contractually specified interface and explicit context dependencies only."

>"What are the characteristics of a component?"

- Reusablity 
- Replaceable
- _Not_ context specific
- Extensible
- Encapsulated
- Independant

> "What are the advantages of using component-based architecture?"

- Ease of deployment
- Reduced cost
- Reusable
- Reliablity
- Ease of development
- Modification of technical complexity
- System maintenance and evolution
- Independant

> "What is 'Props' short for?"

- "Props" is a special `keyword` in React and stands for **properties**

> "How are props used in React?"

- Props are used in React as a way to pass data between components.

  1. Define an attribute and its value(data).
  2. Pass it to child components using `props`
  3. Then, render the `props` data!

> "What is the flow of props?"

- The data flow with props is uni-directional, or one direction from `parent` - `child`.

**Please see the linked article in the footnotes to read more about props.**

## Closing notes

Since first starting on my programming journey I have been looking forward to learning more about **React** So I can't WAIT to finally get started.
