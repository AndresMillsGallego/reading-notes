_**What is it?**_

`useReducer` is an alternative to the `useState` hook.  
It accepts a reducer of the type `(state, action) => newState`
It returns the current state, paired with a `dispatch` method. 
See this code snippet:

```JavaScript
const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, initialArg, init);
```

`state` needs to be set as well, and this is often done by setting an `initialState` object that gets updated by using the reducer. 

Check out this code example:

```JavaScript
const initialState = {count: 0};

function reducer(state, action) {
  switch (action.type) {
    case 'increment':
      return {count: state.count + 1};
    case 'decrement':
      return {count: state.count - 1};
    default:
      throw new Error();
  }
}

function Counter() {
  const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, initialState);
  return (
    <>
      Count: {state.count}
      <button onClick={() => dispatch({type: 'decrement'})}>-</button>
      <button onClick={() => dispatch({type: 'increment'})}>+</button>
    </>
  );
}
```

As you might guess, this sets state with the lone property of `count`. 
Then depending on the action "type" it is either incremented, or decremented by using the reducer hook.

`useReducer` seems amazing right?  I agree, it is!  
There are however, some instances when it may not be the best thing to use:

- When your app needs a single source of truth
- When you want a more predictable state
- When state-lifting to the top component isn't enough
- State persistance
