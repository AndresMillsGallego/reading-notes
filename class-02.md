# Reading Notes Class 02
In today's reading we learned more about HTML elements, specifically the ones that can be used to relay semantic information.  

We also were introduced to CSS and read about what it is, what it can do and why to use it.

In our second book[^1] we read about Javascript, the logic it uses and on "decistions and loops"

Below I will highlight some of the things we learned. 

## HTML
  1. Elements are what are used to describe the structure of a webpage.  
  2. They can provide semantic information and are useful to convey the author's intent for the content as well as for any screen reader to better understand the message.  
  3. Some of the elements I found particularly useful are: `<strong>,<blockquote> and <em>`

### CSS
  1. CSS stands for "Cascading Style Sheets"
  2. As the name implies, it is what programmers use to add style to a webapage.  This includes everything from font, color and layout. 
  3. You can code CSS directly into your HTML document either with "inline" or "internal" CSS, but it is considered best practice to keep your CSS in it's own separate file.  
  4. Think of each HTML element as being inside an invisible box.  When you call that element with CSS you can change what happens inside that box (including making the box visible)!
  5. CSS code is made up of:
    
    1. Selectors:  These specify the element that you are selecting to style
    2. Declarations: These tell HTML what you want to do with the elements that are selected.  

### Javascript
  1. A script is like a recipe for the computer.  Much like with a recipe, you have to pay special attention to not only _what_ you want the computer to do, but _how_ and _when_ you want these steps to happen. 
  2. Scripts are made up of statements.  Each statement is like a step in your recipe!
  3. Variables are what are used to store bits of information in the script.  These can vary, and change several times in a script.  Or, they can stay the same throughout.  
  4. Conditional statements can be extremely useful!  Booleans especially I think are amazing data types.  I particularly like how the book referred to them as "on/off switches'
  5. Comparison operators are what you use to compare two operands. 

    - `===, !==, ==, !=, <, >, <=, =>` are examples of comparison operators
  6. Logical operators (using booleans) allow one to compare multiple sets of comparison operators.  
  7.  I think that the `if...else` statements are some of the most useful in all of Javascript! So much can be done with them.  

I thouroughly enjoyed the reading for this class.  I felt it did a great job of expanding our knowledge on these subjects while whetting our appetite for more.
