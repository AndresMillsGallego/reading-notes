- What is node.js?
  - Per the docs[^2]
  > Node.js® is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome’s V8 JavaScript engine.
- In your own words, what is Chrome’s V8 JavaScript Engine?
  - According to the article, the engine is used to compile JS to a native machine code that the machine can run.  The name "V8" makes sense as it was built with performance in mind.
- What does it mean that node is a JavaScript runtime?
  - It means that it is a program that can be used to run JS code on our computers.
- What is npm?
  - NPM is a package manager that comes with Node.js.
- What version of node are you running on your machine?
  - I am running **v16.13.1**
- What version of npm are you running on your machine?
  - I am running **8.1.2**
- What command would you type to install a library/package called ‘jshint’?
  - You would type `npm install -g jshint`

- What are the 6 reasons for pair programming?
  1. Greater Efficiency
  2. Engaged Collaboration
  3. Learning From Fellow Students
  4. Social Skills
  5. Job Interview Readiness
  6. Work Environment Readiness
- In your experience, which of these reasons have you found most beneficial?
  - I would have to say for me personally, #'s 3 and 6.
- How does pair programming work?
  - As the article mentions, there are many styles.  At one meet-up I attended where the talk was on pair programming, the style that is used at Code Fellows was referred to as "Strong Pair Programming".  This style involves a **Driver** and a **Navigator**.  The **Driver** is the one at the keyboard, navigating screens and writing the actual code.  Meanwhile, the **Navigator** is the one driving the code by communicating verbally to the **Driver**, but not actually writing any code themselves.
