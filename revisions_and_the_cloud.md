# Getting Started with Git

Before we get too far we have to ask...what is Git? 
To answer that question we need to talk about about another term which is **Version Control System**
    In essense, a Version Control System is a system that lets you revisit parts of a file in its various stages.  
    This makes revision, editing and trouble shooting much easier.  

* At first there were **Local Version Control (VCS** systems that develpers made, but these were limited to the sole local hard disc.  
* Then the **Centralized Version Control (CVCS** systems came to be due to the need for collaboration between programmers.  
* The CVCS while better than the VCS, still had one major problem and that was having it all on one server.  
    That meant that if the single server became compromized or corrupted all the work could be lost.  

**Distributed Version Control (DVCS)**

The DVCS is like the CVCS except it allows the creation of mirrored repositories which act as data backups.  
With this option along with the allowance of multiple mirrored repositories teams of programmers can work together much easier on a given project.
