# Images, Text and Color!!

The fun stuff!  These two things are some of the first things that stand out on a website.  
There was great stuff in this week's readings here[^1] and here[^2].

## Chapter 5

We learned that the `<img>` tag is what is used to add an image to a web page.  
In 102 we used the `src` attribute which tells the computer where to find the image.  We used image address from images found online, but you can also use `src` to lead to a locally stored image.  These are most often found in a separate image folder, or several folders within a main folder. 

Images should be saved in 1 of 3 formats:

1. **JPEG** - These are best used where a lot of detail is needed such as photographs

2. **GIF** - These are often used for images that are animated.

3. **PNG** - These are great for transparent images, images with flat colors or logos.

You should save each image for your site at the appropriate size and format. 

### Chapter 11 

CSS gives you so many tools to manage and manipulate color on your site.  You can control the color, shade, opacity and any combination of then all! 

There are three ways to _specify_ colors in CSS
  - RGB Values (which stands for **R**ed**G**reen**B**lue)
  - Hex Codes (Also represent color values in red green and blue using hexadecimal codes)
  - Color Names (There are 147 predetermined color names in CSS)
  - CSS3 added an additional value to RGB and HSL values which controls the opacity (RGBA and HSLA respectively).

  #### Chapter 12

  First off, I loved the subtle dig at PCs on pp272:
  >> "If you design on a Mac, it is important to check what the typefaces look like on a PC because PCs can render type less smoothly.  But if you design on a PC, then it should look fine on a Mac"

Another fact I found interesting was that many word processing porgrams have standard sizing for text and this is due to a scale that was developed in the 16th century!  

It is _quite_ impressive that their style was so good that it hasn't really been improved in the last 400 or so years.  

There are many, many different fonts that you can use in your CSS, but they will only show if the user's computer has them installed.  Due to that fact it is good to use a `font-family` to make sure your content is read.  

Aside from that you can use CSS to contral font size, **weight**, *style* and s p a c i n g!
