- In your own words, describe what each group of status code represents

  - 100’s = Relays information, more specifically that the header portion of the request has been received.
  - 200’s = Success codes!  These can tell the client that their request was successfully accepted.
  - 300’s = Redirection codes.  These tell the client that what they are looking for can no longer be found there, or a better way of putting it, "These aren't the droids you are looking for.."
  - 400’s =  Error codes!  Specifically on the client side of things.
  - 500’s =  Error codes!  Specifically on the server side.
- What is a status code 202?  
  - Accepted!  This code indicates that their request was accepted, but will be completed some time in the future.
- What is a status code 308?
  - Permanent redirect!  This code tells the client to use a different URL for their request.
- What code would you use if an update didn’t return data to a client?
  - `204` No content!
- What code would you use if a resource used to exist but no longer does?
  - `410` Gone!
- What is the ‘Forbidden’ status code?
  - `403` Forbidden!  Unauthorized access.

- Why do we need to pull our MongoDB database string out of our server and put it into our .env?
  - Becuase we don't want this to be visible once we start using our MongoDB database.
- What is middleware?
  - It is code that gets run once the server gets a request, but before it is actually passed to our routes.
- What does app.use(express.json()) do?
  - This lets our server accept `json` using `get`.
- What does the /:id mean in a route?
  - The colon in front means that it is a parameter and using `.params` gives us access to the data that is passed in after the colon.
- What is the difference between PUT and PATCH?
  - `PATCH` is used when we only want to update the relavent data that gets passed in from the user as opposed to all of the data.
- How do you make a default value in a schema?
  - Simply by setting a value to the `default` property.
- What does a 500 error status code mean?
  - A `500` status code means that the error in question happened on the side of the server.
- What is the difference between a status 200 and a status 201?
  - A `201` status code means that something has been successfully created, while the status code `200` simply means "successful"  `201` is a more specific response saying what actually was successful!
