 > "This is the idea of assigning system access to users based on their role in an organization"

As the article points out, not everyone needs a starring role in an organization!  
The idea behind this is that if users are grouped into certain roles based on a common job, or responsibility, then access can be assigned to each person based on their role.  This makes access management much easier.

Some think that this sounds too complicated, especially with smaller companies.  The truth is however, that it is relatively easy to set up, it becomes systematic _and_ repeatable, and is easier to audit and correct as needed.

RBAC Implentation:

1. Inventory your systems.
2. Analyze your workforce and create roles!
3. Assign people to these roles.
4. Never make one-off changes.
5. Audit.

> USER => ROLE => RIGHTS

The idea is that:

- The user authenticates themselves to the system
- The user can then activate one or more roles for themselves
- The user can then have access to only what is appropriate for that role.

RBAC Benefits:

- The policy doesn't apply to an individual.  If a person leaves the organization, the policy does not need to change
- A brand new employee should be able to gain appropriate access based on their role when hired.
