# React Forms **&** the Ternary Operator (get it? 😁)

## React Docs Forms[^1]

- What is a ‘Controlled Component’?
  - It is an input element that as it's value controlled by React.
- Should we wait to store the users responses from the form into state when they submit the form OR should we update the state with their responses as soon as they enter them? Why.
  - If I understand it correctly the data is saved with each keystroke.  This is done so that the data can be stored quickly and used in other elements.
- How do we target what the user is entering if we have an event handler on an input field?
  - This is done with the `value:`. It there are multiple elements, then the `name:` property can be used, then the value from that property is used to store the data.

## The Conditional (Ternary) Operator Explained[^2]

- Why would we use a ternary operator?
  - As the article states, this operator is used to shorten your `if` statements into one line of code.
- Rewrite the following statement using a ternary statement:
  - Original Code
  > `if(x===y){` <br>
  `console.log(true);` <br>
`} else {` <br>
  `console.log(false);` <br>
`}`

  - New code
  > `x === y ? console.log(true) : console.log(false)`
