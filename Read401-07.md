## JWTs Explained[^1]

_What are JWTs?_

- They can securely transfer information between two bodies
- They are open standard (anyone can use them)
- They are digitally signed - information is verified and trusted
- They are compact!
  - They can be sent via `URL`, `POST` request, `HTTP` header, etc.
- They are self-contained!
  - Contains information about the user
  - Avoids querying the database more than once

## Intro to JWT[^2]

JWT Structure:

- Header
  - contains the `alg` (algorithm) and `typ`, or the type (JWT)
  ``` JavaScript
  {
  "alg": "HS256",
  "typ": "JWT"
  }
  ```
- Payload
  - This is what comes from the user
  ``` JavaScript
  {
  "sub": "1234567890",
  "name": "John Doe",
  "admin": true
  }
  ```
- Signature
  - This is the `header`, the `payload` and the `secret` all encoded with the selected algorithm
  ``` JavaScript
  HMACSHA256(
  base64UrlEncode(header) + "." +
  base64UrlEncode(payload),
  secret)
  ```

Once you putt all three together, the result is a color coded concatenated string that looks something like this:

## Are JWTs Secure?[^3]

How secure is secure.....really?  Best I can understand, JWT tokens do an excellent job at concerning themselves with two things:

1. The Signature
2. If they match

So the concern isn't so much on if the payload gets altered, since any alteration (even one made by the original user) will change the signature.

I don't think JWTs are meant to store super sensitive information, but they are still an excellent resource.
